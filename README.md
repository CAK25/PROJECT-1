# PROJECT-1
Analyze Covid-19 Data
The purpose of this project is to analyze how much of an impact poverty and gender have on severity of COVID-19. 
Do counties with a higher poverty level have higher covid 19 mortality rates?
Do males have a higher covid 19 mortality rate than females?
Is there a combined effect of poverty level and gender that causes a much higher fatality rate than having just one of the two conditions?
